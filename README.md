## What I've Been Doing

**iotum** — Software & QA Engineer  
*Summer 2025*

Spent the term fixing how we test SDKs. Cut QA time in half by automating the boring parts. Built onboarding flows that actually made sense to new developers.

**Cineplex** — Data Engineering  
*Winter 2024*

Dealt with petabytes of box office data that didn't match between systems. Wrote pipelines to catch errors before they broke dashboards. Helped tune prediction models so they'd actually run on time.

**Alterra / Blue Mountain** — Systems & Analytics  
*Summer 2023*

Rebuilt check-in workflows for resort properties. Dug through SQL to find patterns that drove upsell revenue. Mostly learned how bad legacy systems can get.

**Deploy:** AWS, Azure, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions

## Things I've Built

**Full-stack e-commerce app**  
MERN stack with auth, cart, checkout. Dockerized everything so it actually runs the same locally and in prod. [Try it](https://mern-store-gold.vercel.app/)

**Box office data pipeline**  
Unified multiple data sources into one dashboard. Added alerts for when numbers looked wrong. Non-technical people could finally answer their own questions.

**ML prediction model**  
Took messy datasets, cleaned them up, validated the inputs. Made the model 15% more accurate and way faster.

**Other random projects**  
MIPS compiler backend. CLI tools to speed up onboarding. Rewrote some ETL jobs that were painfully slow.
