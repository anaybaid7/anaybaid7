# Hey, I'm Anay Baid üëã

I'm a **Computer Science student** at the University of Waterloo, and I'm all about using **technology to solve real-world problems**. From building full-stack apps to optimizing machine learning models, I'm constantly exploring new ways to make systems smarter and more efficient.

I love to code, experiment with new technologies, and collaborate on projects that have a tangible impact. Whether it's **data engineering**, **cloud computing**, or **software development**, I‚Äôm always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what tech can do.

## What I‚Äôve Been Up To

### **Data Engineering at Cineplex**
I had an awesome opportunity at **Cineplex Entertainment** where I worked on improving how the company tracks **box office data** using **Power BI**. I optimized their machine learning algorithms, and even worked on a massive **Azure data validation** project that saved tons of time and made sure the data was spot-on.

### **Full-Stack Development Projects**
I‚Äôm super passionate about building web applications. Recently, I built a **MERN stack e-commerce platform** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) from the ground up. It was a great way to get my hands dirty with **Redux**, **Docker**, and **CI/CD**. I‚Äôve also been experimenting with **machine learning**, using Python to make sense of large datasets and build smarter prediction models.

### **Optimizing Business Systems**
In my internship at **Alterra Mountain Company**, I worked on improving their **property management system**‚Äîthink reducing guest check-in times and speeding up data retrieval for large hotel chains. The goal was to make the system **faster, smarter, and more scalable**, and it felt great to see the real-world impact of the work.

## What I Love to Work With 

I‚Äôm all about building efficient, scalable systems. Here are some tools and languages I enjoy working with:

- **Languages**: C, C++, Python, JavaScript, Java, SQL, TypeScript, Kotlin, HTML/CSS
- **Tech**: React, Node.js, Django, Spring Boot, Flutter, Tailwind CSS
- **Cloud & Tools**: AWS, Azure, Docker, Git, Gitlab, MongoDB, JUnit
- **Data**: Power BI, SQL, Machine Learning, Data Analysis

## A Few Cool Projects I‚Äôve Worked On 

### **MERN E-Commerce Site**
I built a fully-functional e-commerce site with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to dive deeper into the full-stack world. It involved working with **Redux** for state management, **Docker** for containerization, and **Vercel** for seamless deployment. It was a blast building something end-to-end and learning how all the pieces come together.

### **Cineplex Data Dashboards**
At Cineplex, I worked on **Power BI dashboards** that pulled in data from multiple sources and gave the team **real-time insights** into box office performance. I wrote **SQL scripts** for data extraction and integrated **Azure** services to automate reporting, saving the team hours of work every week.

### **Machine Learning Optimizations**
I helped improve Cineplex‚Äôs **show-time prediction algorithm** by evaluating and tweaking the machine learning models. By cleaning and validating data, I was able to increase the model‚Äôs accuracy by 15%. It was rewarding to see the impact of the work on such a large scale.

## How I Think About Tech 

Tech is all about **innovation** and **problem-solving**. When I work on a project, I always start by trying to understand the bigger picture‚Äîwhy the problem matters, who it affects, and how I can approach it in a way that‚Äôs scalable and efficient. I don‚Äôt believe in a one-size-fits-all solution, so I‚Äôm always open to experimenting with different technologies and strategies to find the best fit.

I love the process of iterating on ideas‚Äî**building, testing, refining**. It‚Äôs what keeps me excited about working with **data**, **software**, and **cloud technologies**. And I truly believe that the most rewarding projects are the ones that challenge me and push me to think outside the box.

## Education & Community 

I‚Äôm pursuing my **Honours Computer Science** degree at the **University of Waterloo**, and I‚Äôve had the chance to get involved with a ton of cool initiatives on campus:

- **Tech+UW**: I helped organize the mentorship program, coordinated events, and led initiatives that brought students together to learn and grow.
- **CS Tutoring**: I‚Äôve also worked as a tutor for **CS136 (Algorithms)**, where I got to help students tackle tough coding problems and improve their algorithm skills.
